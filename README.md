# Asendia Voice Agent Eval

Eval harness for AI candidate screening agents — built as a Product Engineer application project for [Asendia AI](https://asendia.ai).

**Primary metric: confidence calibration (ECE), not accuracy alone.**

## Results (hand-curated golden set — no API key needed)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Golden set | 100 staffing phone screens ([spec](docs/DATASET.md)) |
| Accuracy | **95.0%** |
| **ECE (calibration)** | **0.48** |
| High-confidence error rate (≥80, wrong) | **1.1%** (1 case) |
| Model | Groq `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` · seed 42 |

> 95% accuracy with poor calibration means confidence scores aren't yet trustworthy for auto-submit thresholds — exactly why this harness exists before production.

## Problem

Staffing agencies need to know not just *"does the agent decide?"* but *"can we trust that decision — and does the agent know when it's uncertain?"*

This repo benchmarks an LLM screening agent against **held-out recruiter submit decisions**, with **confidence calibration** as the primary metric.

## What it does

1. Loads a **100-record staffing screen eval set** — curated for Sarah-style phone screens
2. **Holds out** `decision` and `reason` during scoring
3. Replays interview **transcripts turn-by-turn** (no label leakage)
4. Runs a scoring agent → `select/reject`, confidence (0–100), reasoning
5. Computes accuracy, precision, recall, **ECE**
6. Surfaces high-confidence failures — confident but wrong

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aravindmohan/asendia-voice-agent-eval.git
cd asendia-voice-agent-eval
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Review results (no API key)
open results/calibration.png
cat docs/REPORT.md

# Validate dataset
python scripts/validate_dataset.py

# Re-run eval (optional)
cp .env.example .env   # add GROQ_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY
python scripts/run_eval.py --no-followups --concurrency 10 --seed 42
```

## Input / Output

**Input:** `transcript`, `resume`, `job_description`

**Output:**
```json
{
  "predicted_decision": "select",
  "confidence": 78,
  "reasoning": "...",
  "risk_flags": [],
  "escalate_to_human": false,
  "turns_processed": 12
}
```
